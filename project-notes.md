# Current Working Items

- Make working GW2 api key fetch and store to db, if successful.
- Re-configure db.

# Future Ideas

- Once bot can read API keys and store them to a database based on user,
  make a web app that that interacts with the database to pull and filter by achievements that are not yet unlocked by content.
